# Chemical vs physical etchback balance

Balancing chemical and physical mechanisms during etchback dry etching is crucial for **precise control**, profile shaping, and selectivity in semiconductor manufacturing.

## Chemical Etchback

- **Mechanism:** Uses reactive radicals (e.g. fluorine from SF₆ or NF₃) in plasma to chemically react with tungsten or dielectric, forming volatile byproducts that are pumped away.
- **Benefits:**
    - High material removal rate
    - High selectivity (can target tungsten over dielectrics/barriers)
    - Gentle on underlying/adjacent structures due to reduced physical damage
- **Limitations:**
    - Tends to be less anisotropic (can cause lateral etching)
    - Difficult to achieve sharp, vertical sidewalls without some physical assistance


## Physical Etchback

- **Mechanism:** Relies on energetic ion bombardment (physical sputtering) from the plasma, physically knocking atoms from the surface.
- **Benefits:**
    - Highly anisotropic (vertical profiles)
    - Essential for clean field removal and precise dimension control
- **Limitations:**
    - Less selective—can damage or erode underlying/barrier layers if not carefully controlled
    - Can cause roughness or “footing”/“notching” defects at feature bases


## Balancing Both Mechanisms (Reactive Ion Etching, RIE)

The optimal etchback process finds a balance:

- **Chemical component** ensures efficient, selective material removal and good uniformity.
- **Physical component** enforces directionality (anisotropy), essential for pattern fidelity and profile control.

**Fine-tuning parameters** such as plasma power (which increases ion energy), chamber pressure, and gas chemistry (ratio of etchant to polymer-forming gases) controls the ratio of physical to chemical effects. For example:

- Higher ion energy → more physical sputtering (better verticality, higher risk of damage)
- More reactive gas (e.g., SF₆) → higher chemical etching (better selectivity, may be more isotropic)
- Addition of polymer-forming gases (e.g., CHF₃, C₄F₈) or oxygen → protective layer builds on sidewalls, improving verticality by preventing lateral etching[^1][^3].

If the balance tips too strongly toward physical etching, damage and roughness increase. If it tips too far toward chemical, you risk undercutting or loss of critical dimension control. Modern tools use monitoring (such as endpoint detection with oxygen concentration) to shift between etch and protection phases, optimizing uniformity and stopping at the precise moment needed[^1].

## Practical Example

- For dense features, more physical etching may be needed to keep profiles vertical.
- For open areas, chemical etching may suffice for high selectivity and throughput.
- Varying process gases and power allows recipes to be tailored for specific applications (e.g., tungsten vs dielectric etchback).

In summary, the **chemical vs physical etchback balance** is adjusted process-by-process to optimize between material selectivity, profile verticality, and defect minimization, with the best-performing recipes merging these mechanisms through reactive ion etching[^1][^3].
